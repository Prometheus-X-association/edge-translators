# Edge translators BB

The Edge Translator Building Block is the core component for translating input data format and value to a standard output. The main benefit of the Translator lies in its ability to ensure the interoperability of jobs, skills and qualifications data. The Translator Building Block is able to receive skills data from a single or multiple sources through an API and translate it into the requested output format/language in real time. The skills framework translations may include any national one to the international ESCO, between almost all the European languages, as well as any Json data structure to Json-ld.
